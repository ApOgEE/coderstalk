# Coder's Talk

Welcome to my **Coder's Talk GitHub** blog. 

Back in Feb 2007, I've started a blog called **Coder's Talk** in blogger platform. Yes, the blog still exists and you may read previous articles on it at https://coderstalk.blogspot.com

This blog on GitHub is not a replacement of that old blog. But I got this idea on creating GitHub blog which I will call glog where I can update my articles using git.

I don't know who will read or follow this blog. But feel free to comments and get engaged with my posts. Have fun!
